NAME
       decode - decode video and audio files

SYNOPSIS
       decode [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This demo uses the Codec Engine to decode data from files and output
       the uncompressed data using peripheral device drivers. Video, speech
       and audio files are supported.  All files must consist of raw encoded
       frames of data (elementary streams).

OPTIONS
       -v <video file>, --videofile <video file>
             Decodes a video file.  The demo detects which type of video file
             is supplied using the file extension.  Supported video algorithms
             are MPEG4 SP (.mpeg4 or .m4v extension) and H.264 BP
             (.264 extension)

       -a <audio file>, --audiofile <audio file>
             Decodes the audio file. The demo detects which type of audio file
             is supplied using the file extension. Supported audio algorithms
             are AAC (.aac extension) & MP3 (.mp3 extension) -- As long as the
             Codec Server contains a valid algorithm to use. 

       -s <speech file>, --speechfile <speech file>
             Decodes a speech file. The demo detects which type of speech
             file is supplied using the file extension. The only supported
             speech algorithm as of now is G.711 (.g711 extension).

       -O <display output>, --display_output
             Selects the video output to display, valid outputs are
             'lcd', 'dvi' or 's-video'. If this parameter is not specified
             the application will use the overlay settings from the system.
             
       -l, --loop
             If this option is selected, the demo will restart at the
             beginning of a file (or files) when the end is reached. If this
             option is not selected (which is the default) the demo will quit
             once the end of the file (or files) has been reached.Priority
             will go to -t(time) if both are specified together 

       -o, --osd
             Enables the On Screen Display for data visualization. If this
             option is not passed, the data will be output to stdout instead.
             Note that if you use dvi or tv output, you will need a USB mouse
             powered by a USB hub connected to the EVM to navigate the UI.

       -k, --keyboard
             Enables the keyboard input mode which lets the user input
             commands using the keyboard in addition to the keypad
             interface. At the prompt type 'help' for a list of available
             commands.

       -t <seconds>, --time <seconds>
             The number of seconds to run the demo. Defaults to infinite time.

       -h, --help
             This will print the usage of the demo.

EXAMPLE USAGE
       General usage:
             ./decode -h

       MPEG4 NTSC video decode and display only with keyboard interface and OSD:
             ./decode -k -o \
                   -v /usr/share/ti/data/videos/davincieffect_480p30.m4v

       H.264 video decode and display on DVI 480P output and AAC audio decode:
             ./decode -O dvi \
                 -a /usr/share/ti/data/sounds/davincieffect_lc.aac \
                 -v /usr/share/ti/data/videos/davincieffect_480p30.264
