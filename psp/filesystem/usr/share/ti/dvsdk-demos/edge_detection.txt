NAME
       edge_detection  -Sobel Edge detection on a video loopback

SYNOPSIS
       edge_detection [options...]

DESCRIPTION
   This application  runs an sobel edge detector on a video loopback between the capture and display 
   device  i.e. the output frame of the capture device is given to a 3x3 sobel edge detector whose output 
   is given as input to the display device. This demo is used to highlight the features that can be added to an ARM
   application by offloading compute intense tasks to the DSP using C6Accel

		auto (select video output by reading sysfs) 

NOTE : If more than once an option is specified it will take the last
       occurence of the option as the input to application and discard other 
       occurences.

EXAMPLE USAGE
       General usage: ( Composite Input LCD display)
             ./edge_detection -O auto
       Note: This will make the demo run in an infinite loop. Use -n option to 
             specify the number of frames after which the demo must terminate.
